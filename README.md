# Silent Firebase Errors from Database Rules

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Firebase: silent failures or unclear error messages arising from overly restrictive or misconfigured database rules.  The example uses JavaScript, but the principle applies to other Firebase SDKs.

The `incorrectRules.js` file shows code that attempts database operations against restrictive rules. The lack of explicit error messages makes debugging challenging.  `correctRules.js` offers a corrected version with improved error handling and more permissive (for demonstration) rules.

This issue is particularly insidious when working with asynchronous operations; the error might not surface immediately and might require extensive debugging.
